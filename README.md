📊 Measuring the Pulse of Prosperity: An Index of Economic Freedom Analysis
🌐 Introduction
Economic freedom is the fundamental right of individuals to control their labor and property. In economically free societies, people are free to work, produce, consume, and invest however they choose—with minimal government interference, only enough to protect and maintain liberty.

Historically, a lack of economic freedom kept billions in poverty. Today, due to expanding economic liberty, the world is witnessing unprecedented prosperity. The Index of Economic Freedom, published by The Heritage Foundation, measures this progress annually.

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the 2022 Index of Economic Freedom, exploring global trends and deriving insights from 12 core indicators across four pillars:

🧱 The Four Pillars
Rule of Law: Property Rights, Government Integrity, Judicial Effectiveness

Government Size: Government Spending, Tax Burden, Fiscal Health

Regulatory Efficiency: Business Freedom, Labor Freedom, Monetary Freedom

Open Markets: Trade Freedom, Investment Freedom, Financial Freedom
